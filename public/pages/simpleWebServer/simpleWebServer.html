    <h2>3.1 Initializing express</h2>
    <p>
      The first thing we need to do in order to setup our web server is to
      import express. We then initialize it. This is done on line 1 and 2 in the
      code section below. Now we need to point express to where our static web
      files will be as can be seen on line 3. Here we have created a public
      folder in the root of our project to hold all of these files. All files
      here can be accessed by others and therefore only frontend files should be
      located here. After this we need to setup to listen on a specific port. It
      would also be nice to have print an error, if there are any, when start or
      else printing that everything went well. We can see on line 5 through 11
      how this is done. First we setup a port. This does not need to be saved in
      a variable but is done here for good measure. Afterwards we use the listen
      function and pass in the port and a callback function. This callback takes
      an error and if this exists we print or else print a success statement

    <h2>3.2 Servering our first page</h2>
    <p>
      In order to for us to server a page we need a place to hold our html, css
      and other frontend files. If you have not created a public folder in the
      root of the project, do that now. Here create a new folder called pages
      and in there a folder called frontpage to hold the frontpage. You can also
      create a folder called assets to hold images and general css code. Create
      an frontpage.html and .css file. Setup the basic html page and add
      something to the page. I have added an h1 with some text to display. Your
      project should look like this

    </div>

    <p>
      The last thing to do is make express server our frontpage. In our app.js
      file we need to setup response to a get request on a specific url. We can
      use express get method to do this just like when setting up the API. The
      difference here is the we need to send a file not data so we use sendFile
      method instead of send. Here we need to point to the correct file and give
      the full path. To get the full path we can use process.cwd or if we are
      not using ES6 we can use __dirname.
