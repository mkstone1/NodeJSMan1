  <h1>4 Working with imports</h1>

  <div>
    <h2>4.1 CommonJS</h2>
    <p>
      So far we have been using CommonJS to import functionality fron other
      moduels that we need. This has been done using the require keywork. This
      was done when setting up express where we imported express using require.
      To export with CommonJS you can use module.exports and then use require in
      another module to import functionality. We will now look at another way of
      doing this.

    <h2>4.2 ES6</h2>
    <p>
      In order to use ES6 we need to update our package.json file. Before our
      dependcies we need to add "type":"module". This will allow us to use the
      import and export statements. When we have done this we can use import
      express from "express"; rather then require.

    <p>
      So far we have been defining our data in the app.js file. Lets move this
      to its own file. Create a folder in the root of your project called utils.
      In here create a javascript file called meatcuts. Copy the array with
      meatcuts into this new file. We now need to export it. To do this add
      export before const. We now need to import it into our app.js file. To do
      this we use desructuring to import meatcuts from meatcuts.js
    </p>

    <div class="code-block-small subCategories">
      <img src="./assets/images/meatcutsImport11.png" />
    </div>
    <div class="code-block-small  subCategories">
      <img src="./assets/images/meatcutsImport1.png" />
    </div>
    <p>
      There is another way of doing this. In our meatcuts.js file we can use
      export default in the bottom the file and export meatcuts here. When we
      then import it in app.js we do not need to use desructuring.
