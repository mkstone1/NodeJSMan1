      <h2>1.4 Initializing project</h2>
      <p>
        When setting up your project there is 2 ways to go about it. You can
        either manually set it up or do it with npm commands
      </p>
      <h3>Manually Initializing your project</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          In your project folder create a file called package.json. Here you
          will list all the dependencies for your project. Here we use express
          as our web application framework and nodemon for auto refresh when
          updating code files. Your package.json should look like this
        </p>
        <div class="code-block">
          <p>
            {"dependencies": <br />
            { "express": "^4.18.2",<br />
            "nodemon": "^2.0.21"}<br />
            }
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          With your dependcies setup you can now run npm i from a terminal to
          download dependencies
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Automaticlly setting up your development environment</h3>
        <p>
          Open a terminal and go to your project folder. Run npm init. Follow
          the prompts. Most should be self explanatory. For entry point write:
          app.js Afterwards do npm i express and npm i nodemon <br>
          Lastly create an app.js in the root of your project <br> <br> <br>
          You are now ready to start coding with Node JS and express.
          To start your project write nodemon.cmd app.js in the terminal
