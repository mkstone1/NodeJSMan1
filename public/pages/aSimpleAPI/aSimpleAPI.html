  <h1>3. Setting up a simple API</h1>

  <div class="subCategories">
    <h2 class="subCategories">3.1 Setting up express</h2>
    <p>
      The first thing we need to do in order to setup our API is to import
      express and initizalise it. The import is done with require, as shown
      below, and we express() to initizalise it. Afterwards we need express to
      listen on some port. We define the port and use the listen function which
      accepts a port and a callback. We use the callback to view an error, if
      any occures, or print a success messages otherwise. This must be last
      thing in our code, so make sure to put everything else before
      app.listen<br /><br />
      We will now use the same data as the last section and setup a get endpoint
      to retrive that data. First we must define it. Now we can use the .get
      function to respond to get request on specific endpoints. This function
      takes the endpoint as the first parameter and a callback as the second.
      The endpoint we define is going to be /meatcuts. The callback has two
      parameter the request and the response. We want to send all the data as a
      response to request on this endpoint. Therefore can use the send funciton
      on the response to specifify what to send as a response. Here we input our
      data as a response. This is the code with everything
    </p>

    </div>

    <p>
      We can now run the code by opening a terminal and going to the root of our
      project. If you installed nodemon previously you can run "nodemon.cmd
      app.js". This will restart the server everytime you make changes in a js
      file. Alternativly you can use "node app.js" to start the server. You will
      need to restart the server everytime you make changes with this approch.
      Now that the server has been started we can go to localhost:port/meatcuts,
      where you should replace port with whatever port you have selected. It is
      recommended to use 8080 as this is the development HTTP port. For
      production HTTP will use port 80. Here we can see the data being served by
      the server. With this approch we get all the data, but what if we just
      want a specific cut or all cuts from a specific animal. There are two ways
      to do this. Through query strings and path parameters
    </p>
    <div class="subCategories">
      <h2>3.2 Query string and path parameters</h2>
      <h3>3.2.1 Query String</h3>
      <p>
        First lets talk about query string. These are pased in the url with
        ?variable=value&anotherVariable=value. This way we can make requests for
        specific data. Lets say we want to get all cuts of meat the belong to a
        chicken. We can do this with a query string where we pass
        ?animal=chicken. Let implement a get quest to service such an endpoint.
        We need some way of getting the variable. We can utilise the request
        received. Inside the get callback function we can do req.query.id, where
        id is the variable name. Now we need to use this to find the correct
        data to send back. We can use the filter method to this and then send
        the filtered array as our response.
      </p>

      </div>

      <h3>3.2.2 Path parameters</h3>
      <p>
        The other way of doing this is through path parameters. Lets start by
        making a new get request to the endpoint /meatcuts/:animal. The :animal
        part will now be our variable passed to the backend. Now instead of
        using req.query.id we use req.params.id to access the varaible.
      </p>

      <h2>3.3 Patch, Post and delete requests</h2>
      <h3>3.3.1 Delete</h3>
      <p>
        Now that we can send data lets look into how to update and delete data.
        We need to use either path parameters or query strings to identify a
        specific data point to edit. We can then use app.delete to delete,
        app.post to create and app.patch to update data. Lets start with delete.
        Create a delete mapping a endpoint and use either query strings or path
        parameters to find a specific data point. I will use path parameters
        here. Since we need to find specific datapoints it will be easier to add
        an id parameter to all the data. This is good practice and i have edited
        in the code below to show how it works. Now it is easy to delete a
        specifc cut using the id. We can use the findIndex function on the our
        data array to find the index of a specific cut and then splice the
        delete one elemtent from the index. I have done a small if statement to
        check if we find anything or else send a appropriate response.
      </p>

      </div>

      <h3>3.3.2 Post</h3>
      <p>
        In order to create new object we need to be able to parse data thats
        coming in. Express has a inbuild parser for json so lets use that. In
        the top of the app.js file add app.use(express.json()). This will tell
        express to use the json parser on the body of incoming requests. Now
        that we can parse the input we get, we can use it to create new entires
        in our meatcuts array. We can again use the request parameter and the
        req.body to access the body of a given request. As we now have IDs we
        need a way to handle how to give IDs to new data. Lets create a
        currentId variable with let and set it to the highest id. We can then
        take the new id and the request body and push this to our array.
      </p>

      </div>

      <h3>3.3.3 Patch</h3>
      <p>
        When we need to update a datapoint we use the patch request. Again we
        need to find a specifc datapoint to edit. This is done in the same way
        as for the delete request. We can use the index to find and update the
        datapoint with whatever data is in the body of the request.
      </p>

      <h2>3.4.1 Using Postman to test our endpoints</h2>

      <p>
        We have now setup endpoints for delete, post and patch request but have
        not tested any of these endpoints. To do this we will use postman. In
        post we can setup request using specific HTTP request methods. For the
        delete mapping we just have to setup a delete mapping and use the path
        parameter to specifify what data point to delete. For post we need to
        send the data we are using to create a new object in the body of the
        request. As we are using the JSON parser we must send the data in a JSON
        format. To do this in postman edit the body and set it to raw and select
        JSON as the type. Now enter the data as JSON with all the attributes
        nessesary to create the object
      </p>
      <div class="code-block subCategories">
        <img src="./assets/images/postRequestPostman.png" />
      </div>
      <p>
        The patch request is a combination of the two previous. We need to use
        the path parameter to specifify what datapoint to edit, and send the a
        body with the data to be edited.
