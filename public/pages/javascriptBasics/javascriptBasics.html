      This section assumes some familiarty with javascript. As such objects,
      arrays, callback functions etc are not covered here.

    <h2>2.1 Variables</h2>
    <p style="text-align: center">
      There are 3 ways to declare a variable in javascript. These are const, let
      and var
    </p>
    <div class="subCategories">
      <h3>2.1.1 Var</h3>
      <p>
        Variables declared using var are either globally scoped or functionally
        scoped. If we look at the code below we can see that we can have a var
        variable defined in the global scope and in the function of getColor.
        However var does not support block level scoping. This means that when
        we redeclare color in the if statement it changes the one declared in
        the global scope. It is also possible to reassign the variable later
        on.<br ><br>
        As a general rule you should not use var
      </p>

      <h3>2.1.2 Let</h3>
      <p>
        The let keyword can function very similar to the var keyword. The can
        both be designed later on. The main difference is that let supports
        block level scoping and cannot be redeclared.

    <div class="subCategories">
      <h3>2.1.3 Const</h3>
      <p>
        Const and let share the block level scoping however cannot redeclare or
        reassign const variables. Therefore they must be assigned a value at
        declaration. You should use the const keywork as much as possible and
        let when needed

    <h2>2.2 Loops</h2>
    <p>
      Normal for and while loops should no longer be used unless used for "hand
      counting". You should use the functional approch and use the loop
      functions decriped here
    </p>
    <h2>2.2.1 Loop function</h2>
    <p>
      Here are the loop function that should be used. They all accept a callback
      funtions
    </p>

    <div>
      <ul style="text-align: left">
        <li>
          Map - Return an array of the same length. You can change the original
          data, mapping the orginal data to something else
        </li>
        <li>
          Filter - Returns an array with less items than the original array
        </li>
        <li>Reduce - Returns a single value which can also be an object</li>
        <li>
          Find - Returns a single items. This will the first item that satifies
          some condition
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <br>
        <br>
        Now let look at practical examples of these methods. In the code below
        we have an array of cuts of meat with the name of the cut, the animal
        and the price. We use the map method to make an unordered list that can
        be used in an html page. We then use the filter method to find all the
        cuts from chicken. The find method is used to the chicken wings. If we
        had used the find method on the tenderloin cut it would have returned
        the first item it found. In this case the pig tenderloin.
