    <h2>6.1 Async await</h2>
    <p>
      Now we would like to get some data from an external api. I am using a
      jokes api that returns a joke when called. To begind with we will setup a
      file for the jokes. In the utils folder i will create a jokes.js file. In
      this file i will make a async function called getJoke. Here i will define
      the URL of the external API. Afterwards i use await and fetch to get data
      from the api. I then use json() since we are getting json formatted data.
      The function will return this result. Make sure to export the function. We
      can set up an endpoint for this and simply return the data. This is the
      same way as in the API section of this documentation.
